# Project One

## Inspiration

- [www.mint.com](https://www.mint.com)  
    The main color pallet and layout was gotten from this website. At first I started with a green background, once I saw this shade of white and use of shadows I had a better idea on how to incorporate it into my project.

- [https://solarify.in/](https://solarify.in/)  
    Solarify is a website I stumbled upon on my research. The way they incorporated a **calculator** on the side which calculates the users savings, sort of how Geico would to display a customers quote instantly; makes the user's decision to switch companies a lot easier and less searching for other companies. Prompting a **contact form** after completing the calculator could be a possible feature. Also near the bottom where they display **past jobs as a carousel** and show the job information I found to be a key feature I could also incorporate. At first once I opened the page for the first time I liked the way the they added the **CSS animation** for the clouds and once I scrolled to the bottom I knew it wouldn't be fair if I didn't add the rotating globe to my design as well as a **CSS animation.**

- [Renewable Energy Template](http://www.templatemonsterpreview.com/fr/demo/73652.html?aff=webcatalog)
    This is a template found online that deals with renewable energy and I liked the responsiveness for the mobile and tablet such as the black header with work hours, address and phone number making it easier for the user to see in a small screen.
